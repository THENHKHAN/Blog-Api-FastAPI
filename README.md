## Blog-Api-FastAPI 
I will be learning `FastAPI` with `DataBase(Sqlite)` , `SqlALchemy`. Created `Crud API` for `blog`.
**INFO** : Go in noor1CrudWithDB/noor2 branch you will get the CRUD api for blog
### CRUD :
- `Create` Blog
- `Show All` blogs
- `Show single blog` with desired id
- `Delete` Blog with desired id
- `Update` Blog with desired id </br>
**NOTE :** `Handled Exception` very well with meaningful message if something get wrong.
